Quick Start
-----------

Include "pinax-theme-jquerymobile" in your requirements file and
"pinax_theme_jquerymobile" in your INSTALLED APPS.

Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
app directories.

Site name comes from Sites fixture.

Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_base.html"

nav & subnav blocks
-----

"nav" and "subnav" blocks content should be something like:

    <li><a data-role="button" data-icon="back" href="{% url acct_logout %}">Logout</a></li>

"nav" block appears in header and "subnav" block in footer

Your pages should have blocks "head_title", "body_title"(with same content as "head_title") and "body" and should extend
"site_base.html".

The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.

by default theme using jquery CDN with latest jquery, jquerymobile.min.js, jquerymobile.min.css

Forms
-----

To style forms,

and do something like:
    
    <form method="POST" action="">{% csrf_token %}
    <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
    {{ form.as_ul }}
    <li><button type="submit">Submit</button></li>
    </ul>
    </form>

* build additional templates for other Pinax-related apps
* add settings option to switch jQuery Mobile themes (A,B,C,D,E) in settings
* add settings option to load jQuery Mobile static files from CDN or use local files.
